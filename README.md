## This is the 1st version

## Business Problem
> Data sources: <br>
  For the first 03 mini-projects and the 5ยบ mini-project, the database was created by the Data Science academy team <br>
  For the 4th project, this is [database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection)


The main objective of these projects is to demonstrate the power of Machine Learning in business.

## Solution Strategy
The projects were made in Python and Spark, as well as other packages in Python.
* [Mini-project 01](https://github.com/Caio-Felice-Cunha/MachineLearning-Combo/blob/main/1%20-%20Linear%20Regression%20to%20predict%20the%20fuel%20consumption%20of%20automobiles.ipynb): Linear Regression to predict the fuel consumption of automobiles.
  * Step 01: Loading the Data and Preparing the Spark Environment;
  * Step 02: Data Cleanup;
  * Step 03: Exploratory Data Analysis;
  * Step 04: Data Pre-Processing;
  * Step 05: Machine Learning Model.

 * [Mini-project 02](https://github.com/Caio-Felice-Cunha/MachineLearning-Combo/blob/main/2%20-%20Predicting%20the%20Outcome%20of%20Soccer%20Matches.ipynb): Multiclass Classification with Decision Trees to build a model capable of predicting the outcome of a soccer match with 3 possible outcomes: victory, defeat or draw.
    * Step 01: Loading the Data and Preparing the Spark Environment;
    * Step 02: Data Cleaning and Transformation;
    * Step 03: Exploratory Data Analysis;
    * Step 04: Data Pre-Processing;
    * Step 05: Machine Learning Model.
  <br>

    * Step 01: Loading the Data and Preparing the Spark Environment;
    * Step 02: Data Cleaning and Transformation;
    * Step 03: Exploratory Data Analysis;
    * Step 04: Data Pre-Processing;
    * Step 05: Dimensionality Reduction with PCA;
    * Step 06: Machine Learning Model.
  <br>
  
 * [Mini-project 04](https://github.com/Caio-Felice-Cunha/MachineLearning-Combo/blob/main/4%20-%20Spam%20Identifier.ipynb): Our goal is to build a model capable of predicting whether a text message is spam or not.
    * Step 01: Loading the Data and Preparing the Spark Environment;
    * Step 02: Data Pre-Processing;
    * Step 03: Natural Language Processing;
    * Step 04: Machine Learning Model.
  <br>
  
 * [Mini-project 05](https://github.com/Caio-Felice-Cunha/MachineLearning-Combo/blob/main/5%20-%20Similar%20Vehicles.ipynb): Here our goal will be to group vehicles by similarity, that is, to create groups of similar vehicles. We will use an unsupervised learning algorithm, giving the algorithm only the input data.
    * Step 01: Loading the Data and Preparing the Spark Environment;
    * Step 02: Data Pre-Processing;
    * Step 03: Standardization;
    * Step 04: Machine Learning.


## Next Steps
* Improve hyperparameters and data classification.

## Disclaimer
This project was largely done in the Data Science Academy, Big Data Real-Time Analytics with Python and Spark course (part of the Data Scientist training)
